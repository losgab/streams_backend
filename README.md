# Streams Backend 
This project was developed as part of a group effort in developing a mockup messaging & management platform similar to Microsoft Teams. It involved using the flask py module to prototype a mini web server that responds to HTTP requests with the appropriate data packets for the frontend (not included here but to be soon). Features of the backend include: 
- login, authentication, password hashing, automated email notifications
- global members, admin members, guests and their associated permissions
- channels, direct messaging between users, posts and messages
- pinned posts/messages, reacts, unread and replied messages
- profile pictures, files storage for users
- persistence & data dumping

Project written in Python, HTTP testing done using Postman, functionality testing done using pytest.
